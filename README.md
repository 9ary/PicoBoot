## FAQ

### I don't understand how it's better than XenoGC

XenoGC is a drive modchip, it can only patch disc data on the fly. This means you have to use a boot disk to run Swiss and play games from an SD card. PicoBoot uses completely different approach, it injects custom payload during console boot sequence. This means it can load any application instead of built in GameCube menu. It can work even if your disc drive has died.

### I installed your modchip and now my console doesn't work

Sorry. I do not take reponsibility for any damages done by installing this modchip. Do it at your own risk!

### Can I use other RP2040 boards?

Yes, go for it. Just respect the license agreements and don't expect me to provide any support for your board. PicoBoot only supports official Raspberry Pi Pico board at the moment. Yes I know XYZ board is smaller and has USB-C - but it doesn't matter, you won't need that USB-C. Also Pico fits perfectly in the console. There is really no need for a smaller form factor. My philosophy is to keep things stupid simple, cheap and available for everyone.

### Will it work if I have XenoGC installed?

Yes, you can use it with XenoGC intalled. Xeno won't be used in that case, PicoBoot will take over the boot process. Just don't install XenoGC if you already installed PicoBoot. Also do not try to remove XenoGC if it's installed already, you can make things worse and destroy your disc drive.

### I appreciate your work. Can I support you in any way?

This project is free and available for everyone. If you want to support anyway, consider using Sponsor button in the top. You can also buy some of my other mods from my Tindie store.
